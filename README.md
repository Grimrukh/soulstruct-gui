# soulstruct-gui

**NOTE**: With the release of [Soulstruct for Blender](https://github.com/Grimrulh/soulstruct-blender) and the 
ever-improving capabilities of `DSMapStudio`, `Smithbox`, etc., this project is in maintenance mode only and is not
being actively developed.

Many-in-one editor GUI for [Soulstruct](https://github.com/Grimrukh/soulstruct) projects (formerly bundled into that
repo).
